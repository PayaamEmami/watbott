# Watbott

This project is currently in development and not yet ready for production.

## What does this project do?

WatBott is a virtual assistant (chatbot) for Twitch chat. This project allows users to connect their Twitch account to provide a dashboard where they can connect and configure their WatBott. 

WatBott can understand user's messages and respond. User's messages could be informational questions such as, "@WatBott how long has this streamer been live?" to silly statements such as, "watbott I know you're just code but I love you!" and WatBott will respond with what *hopefully* would seem like a normal answer (possibly with some twists). 

Technically, WatBott is a chatbot, but I prefer to use the title "virtual assistant" to hopefully inspire a more forward thinking approach to what new technologies and functionalities that can be brought to Twitch chatbots.

## Why is this project useful?

What makes this chatbot/project useful is the power that Watson Assistant provides, which is the ability to understand a user's intent and allows WatBott to respond with a dialogue. 

This eliminates the need for a user to:
* Memorize custom commands
* Go to a webpage (directing their attention away from the Twitch stream) to learn custom commands

Having the ability to understand input and respond with proper dialogue could and should provide solutions for numerous useful features that chatbot's could and should have. The project is open-sourced in hopes that others can contribute to or be inspired to create their own and better versions of WatBott that does include those numerous features. I expect this section to expand as the project matures. 

## How do I get started?

If you are looking to contribute please feel free to email me: contact@payaame.com

This is my first open-source project, therefore:
* I don't have experience in efficent ways for others wanting to contribute
* I'm uncertain if there is anyone out there who wants to contribute

The approach to project management is different from one person's side project compared to an active open-source project with multiple contributers. So if need be, this section and workflow could change.
