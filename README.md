# WatBott

This project is currently in development and not yet ready for production.

## What does this project do?

WatBott is a virtual assistant (chatbot) for Twitch chat. This project allows users to connect their Twitch account to provide a dashboard where they can connect and configure their WatBott. 

In Twitch chat, WatBott can understand user's messages and respond. User's messages could be informational questions such as, "@WatBott how long has this streamer been live?" to silly statements such as, "watbott I know you're just code but I love you!" and WatBott will respond with what *hopefully* would seem like a normal answer (possibly with some twists). 

Technically, WatBott is a chatbot, but I prefer to use the title "virtual assistant" to hopefully inspire a more forward thinking approach to what new technologies and functionalities that can be brought to Twitch chatbots.

## Why is this project useful?

What makes this chatbot/project useful is the power that Watson Assistant provides, which is the ability to understand a user's intent and allows WatBott to respond with a dialogue. 

This eliminates the need for a user to:
* Memorize custom commands
* Go to a webpage (directing their attention away from the Twitch stream) to learn custom commands

Having the ability to understand input and respond with proper dialogue could and should provide solutions for numerous useful features that chatbot's could and should have. The project is open-sourced in hopes that others can contribute to or be inspired to create their own and better versions of WatBott that does include those numerous features.

## How do I get started?

If you are looking to contribute please feel free to email me: contact@payaame.com

This is my first open-source project and I don't have experience with contributing to open-source projects. This project started as and still is my side project. I'm also uncertain if there is anyone out there who wants to contribute. So I will continue to treat this project as such until changes are needed.
